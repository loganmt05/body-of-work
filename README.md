Projects and work of note

# Introduction
My name is Logan Tidstrom, and I am a software engineer with experience in backend and full-stack development, big data, data analytics, and search tenchologies.
I am originally from Boulder, Colorado, and I graduated with a double major, completing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Spanish.

Through work experience, I have gained  skills in numerous technologies, including Spark, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, Python, SQL, React, Javascript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Hive, Kafka, and Oozie, among others.
I am interested in continuing to learn new skills, and aim to find meaningful ways to contribute to the world via software development.

Outside of work, you can find me playing sports (basketball, volleyball, or swimming), reading books, catching a movie at the theater, or practicing new languages on Duolingo.


# Work Experience
## Target: Marketing Messaging Platform
The Marketing Messaging Platform (MMP) team is responsible for sending personalized marketing messages to millions of Target guests every day.
MMP handles message creation from start to finish, by:
1) owning and maintaining the UI used by business partners to plan and schedule email and push campaigns
2) owning and maintaining the corresponding API service and databases that power the UI 
3) automating and monitoring workflows that create audience segments and mailing plans according to business logic (for daily planned marketing sends)
4) automating and monitoring the pipelines that determine relevant trigger messages for guests (including abandoned cart and browse history reminders)

## Target: Technology Leadership Program
As a member of Target's September 2020 Technology Leadership Program (TLP) cohort, I completed two 6-month rotations on different teams.

### Team 1: Stores Pricing and Presentation
The Stores Pricing and Presentation (SPP) team is responsible for the organization and distribution of store layouts called "planograms" for all Target stores.
As a TLP on SPP, I contributed to the internal UI and corresponding REST API service that makes the planograms accessible to business partners.

Major contributions:
- Added functionality to the UI using React and Javascript.
- Enhanced the Kotlin-based API by adding new endpoints and improving existing endpoints.
- Completed work according to the team's Agile framework, and released changes regularly to comply with the team's CI/CD expectations.
- Attended a seminar on test-driven development and introduced learned techniques to the team.

### Team 2: Marketing Messaging Platform 
After my second TLP rotation, I chose to stay on my second team (see section above for more details).


# Leadership Experience
I am passionate about mentorship, and have participated as a mentor in programs in both high school and college.
I am grateful I have been able to continue serving as a mentor during my career through various opportunities:

## Target Technology Leadership Program Onboarding

### TLP Pod Coach (July 2021)
Pod coaches are responsible for guiding four new TLP engineers to their roles at Target. 
The TLP role is often the engineers' first corporate role out of college, so the focus of onboarding is on introducing them to Target's culture, building a strong technical foundation, and ensuring psychological safety at work.
Once selected, I was assigned four new engineers, whom I led through the three-week onboarding program by providing assistance during technical tasks and workshops, leading group discussions, and acting as a resource during the three weeks and beyond.

### TLP Facilitator (September 2021)
Facilitators are responsible for organizing and executing the three-week TLP onboarding session for a cohort of new engineers.
Once selected, I was accountable for onboarding a cohort of 40 engineers to Target.
I scheduled and moderated panel discussions with existing engineers and fireside chats with Target leadership, including then-CIO Mike McNamara to provide both information and inspiration to the new engineers. 
I prioritized clear communication about schedule and expectations to engineers and Pod Coaches to ensure attendance and participation. 
I facilitated daily conversations among the engineers to foster community in the cohort. 
I led a daily retro with the Pod Coaches assigned to the cohort to validate progress and incorporate feedback.

## Intern Mentorship

### Summer Intern Mentor (Summer 2022)
My manager selected me as the lead mentor for one of our summer interns.
I provided guidance to the intern by suggesting stories to work on and setting up foundational informational sessions on each aspect of our product to help the intern feel comfortable on the team.
I set up regular pair programming sessions and ensured I was an accessible resource for any questions to help the intern past any blockers and to guide him toward independent work by the end of the internship.

### Genesys Works Intern Mentor (2023)
My manager assigned me as the lead mentor for our Genesys Works high school intern.
The Genesys Works program is designed to offer valuable professional experience to high school students in Minnesota.
I met with our intern as needed to introduce technical concepts and to pair program on an API endpoint that was her first experience with coding.
I met with our intern multiple times each week to discuss personal and professional goals.

## Other

### Target TLP Newsletter Writer and Editor
I contributed multiple articles about news and information pertaining to Target to our engineer-run newsletter.
I co-edited three editions of the newsletter by recruiting contributors, organizing content and deadlines, acting as the final editor of all content, and distributing the final product to the Target community.
