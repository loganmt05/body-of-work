# On-Call / Support

- Task: Contribute as a member of the team's support rotation to resolve issues in our processes as they arise.
- Details: Complete week-long on-call stints as primary or secondary support, handling any errors or failed processes. This required a deep understanding of the breadth of our product, including how to troubleshoot and resolve a wide array of issues. The expectation of support was that any issues were resolved efficiently enough that daily message/trigger sends were not impacted.
- Learnings:
  - How to triage a job failure according to job logs.
  - The nature of the 24/7 support rotation meant that it was common to get called to resolve an issue overnight, when you may be the only team member online. These situations required the ability to troubleshoot issues using a number of tools and techniques independently, relying only on myself.
  - How to determine root cause analysis and communicate requirements, impact, and next steps to partner teams (both upstream and downstream).
